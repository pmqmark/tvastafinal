• Uses low-carbon cement blends (e.g., fly ash, GGBS, and geopolymeric materials) to reduce Portland cement usage
• Elimination of Formwork
• Automated processes minimize unnecessary energy consumption compared to conventional construction
• On-site printing eliminates excessive transport of precast components, reducing fuel emissions

Total Carbon Footprint:
• Reduced cement use (~20-30% CO₂ savings)
• Minimizing waste & formwork (~10-15% savings)
• Lower transportation emissions (~5-10% savings)`,

Design Phase:
• File generation for 3D Printing is done post confirmation of Structural, MEP layouts which reduces the time taken for site execution

Site Execution:
• Lesser no. of critical path deviations during project execution since all of the layouts are approved before project execution reducing no.of changes post approval

Skilled Labour dependency:
• Automating processes reduces the need for skilled labour required to finish specific part of the activities thereby reducing delays involved in project execution

Integrated Finishing with minimal plastering:
• 3D Printed Surface finish reduces the need for final surface finishing, thereby reducing the material and time required for finishing activities
• Pre-planned MEP positions and conduits, reducing integration time post 3D Printing activity completion`,
